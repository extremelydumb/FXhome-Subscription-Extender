<h1>FXhome Subscription Extender</h1>
<i><strong>What does this do?</strong></i>
<p>This allows a 1 month or 12 month or whatever subscription to FXhome's either Creator or Pro tiers to run for forever even after the subscription expires.</p>
<p>It's quite dumb to even give FXhome any money at this point but if you're like me I really liked using HitFilm so I bought a subscription because it's a lot cheaper than buying HitFilm Pro once was. With this program, you can essentially get perpetual HitFilm Pro for $20</p>
<hr>
<i><strong>How to use:</strong></i>
<p>1 - Purchase an FXhome subscription</p>
<p><i>NOTE: Support no longer responds to cancellations. I HIGHLY recommend that you use a Privacy.com or prepaid card with no more than $20 (if you're getting Monthly Pro) loaded to it.</i></p>
<p>2 - Login to HitFilm and/or Imerge and ensure that the Pro subscription is active. The top left of the program should say either HitFilm Pro or Imerge Pro.</p>
<p>3 - Download this tool.</p>
<p>4 - Run "backuplicenses.bat" and ensure that in the folder that it creates ("License Files") that there is a folder with your Hardware ID and that there are valid licenses files in there ("HitFilm.license" and/or "Imerge.license")</p>
<p>5 - Move the "blockinternet.bat" to this directory:    C:\Program Files\FXhome\    and run it as admin.</p>
<p><i>If you have more FXhome products other than the subscription ones, then place this file in both the HitFilm and Imerge folder and run them serperately as admin.</i></p>
<p>6 - Open RunAsDate.exe and create a shortcut for HitFilm and/or Imerge. To do this, in the "Application to run" field, put C:\Program Files\FXhome\HitFilm\HitFilm.exe OR C:\Program Files\FXhome\Imerge\Imerge.exe (YOU CANNOT DO THESE AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE TO BE DONE SERPERATELY) and set the date to be any date that your subscription is valid. I usually just put the second day the subscription is valid (for example if you bought it on 2/14/23 then type 2/15/23 in RunAsDate). Change the shortcut's name if you want to, and hit "Create Desktop Shortcut".</p>
